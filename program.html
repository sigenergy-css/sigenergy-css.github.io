**Title:** Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning 

**Abstract:** Machine learning and AI have seen great advances in recent years and are increasingly being applied across society. In this talk, we will see how machine learning can be a powerful tool in helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to a changing climate. From grid optimization to resilient infrastructure, we will explore high impact problems where existing gaps can be filled by machine learning. We will also consider common pitfalls and broader societal considerations involved in working within this space. 

**Bio:**    David Rolnick is Assistant Professor and Canada CIFAR AI Chair in the School of Computer Science at McGill University and at the Mila Quebec AI Institute. He is a co-founder and chair of Climate Change AI and serves as scientific co-director of Sustainability in the Digital Age. Dr. Rolnick has also worked at Google and DeepMind, and is a former NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow, NSF Graduate Research Fellow, and Fulbright Scholar. He received his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from MIT.

**Title:** How new kinds of computer networks can reduce the environmental impact of cloud computing 

**Abstract:** Computing underpins much of modern life.  Social media, entertainment, telepresence, video conferencing, smart cars, and the so-called "Internet of Things" are all enabled by cloud computing, hosted in large-scale Internet datacenters. These datacenters represent a large--and growing--customer of energy as part of their operations. In this talk, I'll describe the role that new types of computer networks can serve in reducing the energy demands of these datacenters as well as enabling cloud computing applications to take increasing advantage of renewable carbon-free power sources. This talk will also describe how the impact of cloud computing on the environment was incorproated into a new undergraduate course offering at UC San Diego focusing on the environmental impact of modern computing systems. 

**Bio:**    George Porter is an Associate Professor in the Systems and Networking Group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego.

**Jay Chen, International Computer Science Institute**

**Title:** Computing, Limits, and Society 

**Abstract:** Technologists are often seen as inventing the future. However, a great deal of our efforts focus on one particular type of future, one very much like the present, only more so. This vision of the future assumes that current trajectories of ever-increasing production and consumption will continue. But humanity collectively faces new global conditions that warrant our attention; we are rapidly approaching, or have already exceeded, a variety of planet-scale limits related to the global climate system, fossil fuels, raw materials, and biocapacity. Many believe that we can solve these problems if we pool our creative resources. In this talk, I’ll explore the hidden assumptions about the future that are embedded in most computing research and what work should be done to respond to challenges that global society faces. 

**Bio:**    Jay Chen is a Senior Researcher at ICSI, UC Berkeley, who spent over 15 years designing and deploying ICTs in a variety of development contexts, from urban slums to rural areas -- working with individuals, development organizations, and other stakeholders. He is a co-organizer of the LIMITS workshop, which concerns the role of computing in the face of real-world limits that are seldom discussed in contemporary computing research.
