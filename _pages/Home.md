#description: In conjunction with <a href="https://energy.acm.org/conferences/eenergy/2021/">ACM e-Energy 2021 conference</a>
---
The first ACM SIGEnergy Workshop on Climate, Sustainability, and Society will be held in conjunction with 
[ACM e-Energy 2021 conference](https://energy.acm.org/conferences/eenergy/2021/). 
Information about the newly established ACM SIGEnergy special interest group can be found at [https://energy.acm.org/](https://energy.acm.org/).

The workshop aims to provide a vibrant venue for researchers in ACM SIGEnergy and other communities to discuss the challenges and opportunities in the intersection of climate change, sustainability, and society. While issues within each of the three areas are of great interest on their own, we believe it is essential to look at the dynamic interplay among the three disciplines.

**Time: June 28, 2 – 5:30 pm, Central European Summer Time**

**Location:** The workshop will be held online.

**Program:**
The workshop features invited talks and a panel discussion. 
Each talk will be 40 minutes long, followed by 5 minute Q&A. 
The panel discussion will last for an hour.
